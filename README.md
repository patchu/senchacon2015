code for Node.js From Scratch: REST API talk

All required modules, including Sequelize and sqlite3, are included in this repo.

To run the server, type<br>
```node restServer.js```

(optional) To re-initalize the sqlite3 data, type<br>
```node dataInit.js```

(Note: the sqlite3 file already comes with 3 rows inserted, so there's no need to do this step unless you want to return to the original data)
